# World Of Heana
TextBase Rpg from Mindwarelab Game Studios

## Background story
The world has forgotten the past, what was before is not know or hiden. You find a small scroll in your uncle actic, the contenet of the document itself was by itself very weird, but what strikes your attention is the date on the document. "The 2nd Moon of Iris - IV era". 
That cannot be right, we are living in the firth era and all we know is that before us there was nothing, something in your mind was screaming that, but something more hidle was wonderig if it was true. Unfortunately, the few books mentioning anything older than hundred moon cycles are lock away in the great library of the capital and only to be read by appointed personal only. In order to seek your answers, you need to go to the great library in person and deliver your discovery to a knwoledge keeper, they are your only hope to unveil this mystery. While rolling back the scroll you noticed something written on the back, it seems someone try to scrap it off the back of the scroll, but you can read the first sentence:"Why we cannot leave the valley?". The answer seems obvious to you, there is nothing outside, everyone knows that. While you thinking about that, you feel not very confortable with the reasons provided in school. You begin to wonder if who wrote the history books is trying to mislead you or do they just do not know the facts and therefore invented a farytale? Meanwhile you are thinking about all these questions you dressed up and fix the bags to begin your journey to the capital.

I am curretly working on this project in my spare time, I hope to achieve something playable in the short run. For playable I mean, leveling up, trading , questing and advancing in the story. The main quest line will be not easy and it will require a good amount of side questing. 


# Opening Positions:
* Art designer. 
I am looking with someone with art skills and wish to coolaborate to the creation of this video game creating artwork, maps, and a logo.
* Python, C++, C# developers.
Someone that has some good experience of working on windows and linux platform. Experience in game production is a plus.
* English Writers.
I need people that wish to write quests and side quests, and use their immagination to populate the world of heana. 

Everyone working on Heana will be rightfully recognized for that in game and outside the game.
