## Background story
The world has forgotten the past, what was before has not matter now. You find a small scroll, the continent of the document itself is not important, but what strikes your attention is the date on this document. "The 2nd Moon of Iris - IV era". 
But how would be possible you are asking to yourself, we are living in the first era. What happened? Why is nobody mentioning the previous times? Where are all the books about that time?Maybe they just are mistaken to write the date? And many other questions start to buzzing in your brain like fireworks. But after a small pause, probably the most important question of your life jump to your mind: "Why, we cannot leave the valley?".

I am curretly working on this project in my spare time, I hope to achieve something playable in the short run. For playable I mean, leveling up, trading , questing and advancing in the story. The main quest line will be not easy and it will require a good amount of side questing. 


# Opening Positions:
* Art designer. 
** I am looking with someone with art skills and wish to coolaborate to the creation of this video game
** creating artwork, maps, and a logo.
* C++ developers.
** Someone that has some good experience of working on windows and linux platform, and that has some experience in game production.
* English Writers.

Everyone working on Heana will be rightfully recognized for that in game and outside the game.
